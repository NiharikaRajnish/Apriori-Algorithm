# Apriori-Algorithm
Python implementation of Apriori Algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule


this algorithm proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The file asociation_rules.py will output the association rules.
